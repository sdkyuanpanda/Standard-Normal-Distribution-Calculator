# Standard-Normal-Distribution-Calculator
A Standard Normal Distribution Calculator that can calculate the z-score and find the percentile from a value, a mean, and a standard deviation value.
The acceptable commands that can be used are: help, z-score, percentile, and quit. Acceptable commands are all in lowercase.
To find the z-score I used the function: (Value-Mean)/Standard Deviation.
To find the percentile I used a function to generate values of percentiles which are the same as the Standard Normal Distribution table.
This function is called the cumulative distribution function which generates values for the Standard Deviation Table.
